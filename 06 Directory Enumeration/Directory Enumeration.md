	Directory enumeration is a way find directories on a web server with tools like `ffuf`

**What kinds of directories would be of importance**

- /wp-admin.php
- /admin
- /admin.php
- /login
- /phpmyadmin

Looking for directories with default configs is web server poor hygiene. An attacker would be able to find a default webpage and run `ffuf` to find, and brute force, their way into those directories.

**Some flags for `ffuf`**:
- --recursion-depth: this is needed to stop enumerating/brute forcing directories as `ffuf` will run forever if you let it and that would be easy to detect

## dirb

Similar to `ffuf` but automatically runs recursively. This tool comes with its own wordlist, as well as being able to test against extensions like `.html` or `.php`.

## dirbuster

`dirbuster` is a GUI application for brute forcing directories.

This tool can assign different threads to offload compute, add wordlists, etc.
