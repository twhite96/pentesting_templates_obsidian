> Why is reconnaissance so important? Public websites give us so much information with plenty of eyes on those websites/web apps, not just you. The more info you find, the better you will be prepared for bug bounty hunting.


## Using Inigriti and others to find bounty programs

There are a few things you could do when doing recon on the companies on bug bounty sites:

- If you're just starting out, look for low paying bounties or free bounties to gain skills. Most of these bounties have few people looking at them because of the pay
- If a domain has a wildcard after the protocol, that means you can test against any subdomains which would be excellent for subdomain enumeration

## Fingerprinting websites

There are plenty of ways to find out what a website is built with and what CMS and analytics they use.

The important part to remember with recon is that maybe you don't have enough information to find a bug for a particular client but what you *do* have is a collection of technologies that could have potential exploits and zero days that you can save and use in another bounty, a bag of tools in your arsenal.

**Tools**
- cURL: `curl -I <domain>` if hit with a redirect: `curl -I -L <domain>`
- `nmap`: best for just scanning ports: `nmap -p80,443 -A <domain>`
